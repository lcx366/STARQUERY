## üõ†Ô∏è How to Install

To install STARQUERY, simply use `pip` in your terminal:

```
pip install starcatalogquery
pip install starcatalogquery --upgrade # to upgrade a pre-existing installation
```

If an error message similar to "`ERROR: Could not build wheels for cartopy, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects`" is displayed, a good solution is

```bash
mamba install h5py
mamba install cartopy 
```

## **üìö** How to Use

Below are some basic examples to help you get started with STARQUERY.

### Build an Offline Star Catalog Database

To start building your database, for example, just download the AT-HYG v2.4 star catalog.

```python
>>> from starcatalogquery import StarCatalog
>>> sc_raw = StarCatalog.get('at-hyg24') # Get the raw star catalog AT-HYG v2.4
>>> print(sc_raw)
```

The `StarCatalog.get()` method fetches the specified star catalog (**at-hyg24** in this example) from the online source, mainly [STScI Outerspace](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/GC/WebServices+for+Catalog+Access) and [The Astronomy Nexus](https://www.astronexus.com/hyg). By default, the downloaded catalog is saved to the **current working directory** under the path: `starcatalogs/raw/at-hyg24/`. The catalog is divided into **K5-level tiles**, following the HEALPix hierarchical structure. This means that the celestial sphere is divided into $4^5 * 12 = 12,288$ tiles, each stored as an individual file. STARQUERY supports a wide range of star catalogs, which are listed below with their corresponding identifiers:

</center>

| Star Catalog Name     | Identifier |
|:---------------------:|:----------:|
| HYG v3.7              | hyg37      |
| AT-HYG v2.4           | at-hyg24   |
| GAIA DR3              | gaiadr3    |
| Guide Star Catalog 30 | gsc30      |
| UCAC5                 | ucac5      |
| USNO-B1.0             | usnob      |
| 2MASS                 | 2mass      |

### Simplify the Raw Star Catalog

The raw star catalog typically contains extensive information about stars, resulting in large file sizes that can slow down query performance. To optimize this, we can extract only the essential information, creating a more compact version of the star catalog.

```python
>>> sc_reduced = sc_raw.reduce()
>>> print(sc_reduced)
```

The `reduce()` method extracts only the essential star attributes: 

- **Celestial Position** (RA, Dec) in degrees

- **Proper Motion** in milliarcseconds per year

- **Apparent Magnitude**

- **Distance** in kiloparsecs

- **Epoch**

The reduced catalog is saved to the current working directory under the path: `starcatalogs/reduced/at-hyg24/`.

### Filter the Reduced Star Catalogs

To further improve query efficiency, the reduced star catalog can be filtered based on the detector‚Äôs magnitude limit. Additionally, proper motion corrections are applied to adjust star positions to bring them closer to the specified observation time.

```python
>>> mag_threshold = 13.0 # Set the magnitude threshold
>>> t_pm = 2019.5 # Set the observation time for proper motion correction
>>> sc_simplified = sc_reduced.simplify(mag_threshold,t_pm)
>>> print(sc_simplified) 
```

The `simplify()` method filters stars based on a specified magnitude threshold (e.g., mag_threshold = 13.0) and updates star positions according to their proper motion, adjusted to the specified observation time (t_pm = 2019.5). The simplified catalog is saved to the current working directory under the path: `starcatalogs/simplified/at-hyg24/mag13.0/epoch2019.5/`.

### Load the Local Offline Star Catalog Database

Once you‚Äôve downloaded and processed your star catalog, you can easily load the local offline database for further analysis. Here‚Äôs how to load the raw, reduced, and simplified star catalogs:

```python
>>> from starcatalogquery import StarCatalog

>>> # Load the raw star catalog
>>> dir_from_raw = 'starcatalogs/raw/at-hyg24/'  # Path to the raw star catalog
>>> sc_raw = StarCatalog.load(dir_from_raw)
>>> print(sc_raw)

>>> # Load the reduced star catalog
>>> dir_from_reduced = 'starcatalogs/reduced/at-hyg24/'  # Path to the reduced star catalog
>>> sc_reduced = StarCatalog.load(dir_from_reduced)
>>> print(sc_reduced)

>>> # Load the simplified star catalog
>>> dir_from_simplified = 'starcatalogs/simplified/at-hyg24/mag13.0/epoch2019.5/'  # Path to the simplified star catalog
>>> sc_simplified = StarCatalog.load(dir_from_simplified)
>>> print(sc_simplified)
```

### Query Stars over a Specific Sky Area

STARQUERY supports both **conical** and **rectangular** queries on the **raw**, **reduced**, or **simplified** star catalogs. Before performing any queries, an index database needs to be prepared to optimize search efficiency.

```python
>>> from starcatalogquery import CatalogDB
>>> sc_database = CatalogDB(sc_simplified._db_path) # Linking databases
>>> sc_simplified.build_indices() # Establish catalog index data table
>>> sc_database.add_table(sc_simplified._indices_path) # Add the data table to the database
>>> print(sc_database)
```

By default, all index files and databases are stored in the current working directory under the path `starcatalogs/indices/`. The index files are organized as CSV files containing hierarchical levels from **K1** to **K11**, along with the **K5_SUB** row number that identifies the position of stars in the **K5****-level files:

| K1  | ... | K5  | ... | K11 | K5_SUB |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:------:|
| 0   | ... | 0   | ... | 267 | 48     |
| 0   | ... | 0   | ... | 366 | 76     |
| 0   | ... | 0   | ... | 421 | 28     |
| 0   | ... | 0   | ... | 846 | 92     |
| 0   | ... | 0   | ... | 492 | 16     |
| 0   | ... | 0   | ... | 775 | 47     |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...    |

üí°If you need to remove any index tables from the database:

```python
>>> sc_database.del_table(sc_simplified._tb_name)
>>> print(sc_database)
```

#### üîç Perform a Star Catalog Query

STARQUERY allows efficient querying of stars over a specific sky area. Depending on the size of the search region, the query system adaptively selects the appropriate hierarchical level and tiles using the **HEALPix** scheme. The package supports both **conical** (circular) and **rectangular** queries on the **raw**, **reduced**, and **simplified** catalogs.

##### Conical Star Query

You can extract all stars within a specified search area by setting a cutoff magnitude and other search parameters.

```python
from starcatalogquery import StarCatalog

# Set search parameters
center = [20, 30]  # Center point [RA, Dec] in degrees
radius = 5  # Search radius in degrees
mag_threshold = 13.0  # Cutoff magnitude
t_pm = 2019.5  # Observation time
max_num = 100  # Optional: Maximum number of stars to return

# Perform a conical search
sc_raw_stars = sc_raw.search_cone(center, radius, mag_threshold, t_pm, max_num=max_num)
print(sc_raw_stars)
```

When performing a star catalog query, especially over a large area, it‚Äôs possible that the brightest stars might cluster in specific regions within the search area. This can lead to an uneven distribution of stars in your results, which may not be ideal for applications like star pattern recognition or celestial navigation. To address this, STARQUERY allows you to **limit the number of stars extracted per HEALPix tile**. This ensures a more even selection of bright stars across the entire search region, preventing a concentration of stars in just one part of the sky.

```python
max_num_per_tile = 5
sc_raw_stars = sc_raw.search_cone(center, radius, mag_threshold, t_pm, max_num_per_tile=max_num_per_tile)
```

Queries on the simplified catalog do not require magnitude truncation or prior proper motion correction.

```python
>>> sc_simplified_stars = sc_simplified.search_cone(center,radius)
>>> print(sc_simplified_stars)
```

During the star query, astronomical corrections can be applied:

    - 'proper-motion': Corrections for the motion of stars across the sky due to their velocities.
    - 'aberration': Corrections for the apparent shift in star positions due to the motion of the observer.
    - 'parallax': Corrections for the apparent shift in star positions due to the change in observer's viewpoint as the Earth orbits the Sun.
    - 'deflection': Corrections for the bending of light from stars due to the gravitational field of the Sun, based on general relativity.

```python
>>> # Define astrometry corrections
>>> astrometry_corrections = {
    't': '2019-02-26T20:11:14.347',  # Observation time (UTC)
    'proper-motion': None,  # Apply proper motion correction if specified
    'aberration': (0.5595, -1.1778, 7.5032),  # Observer's velocity (vx, vy, vz) in km/s
    'parallax': None,  # Apply parallax correction if specified
    'deflection': None  # Apply light deflection correction if specified
>>> }

>>> # Perform a conical query with corrections
>>> sc_simplified_stars = sc_simplified.search_cone(center, radius, astrometry_corrections=astrometry_corrections)
>>> print(sc_simplified_stars)
```

##### Rectangular Star Query

The rectangular query works similarly to the conical search but defines a rectangular region instead.

```python
>>> radec_box = [5, 15, 15, 25]  # [ra_min, dec_min, ra_max, dec_max] in degrees
>>> mag_threshold = 13.0  # Cutoff magnitude
>>> t_pm = 2019.5  # Observation time
>>> max_num = 100  # Optional: Maximum number of stars to return

>>> # Rectangle search on the raw catalog
>>> sc_raw_stars = sc_raw.search_box(radec_box, mag_threshold, t_pm, max_num=max_num)

>>> # Rectangle search on the reduced catalog
>>> sc_reduced_stars = sc_reduced.search_box(radec_box, mag_threshold, t_pm, max_num=max_num)

>>> # Rectangle search on the simplified catalog (no magnitude limit needed)
>>> sc_simplified_stars = sc_simplified.search_box(radec_box, max_num=max_num)
>>> print(sc_simplified_stars)
```

### Calculate the Pixel Coordinates of the Filtered Stars

After filtering the stars, you can convert their celestial coordinates (RA, Dec) into pixel coordinates using the **TANGENT (TAN) projection** in the World Coordinate System (WCS). This transformation is particularly useful for aligning star catalogs with image sensors or star trackers.

```python
>>> pixel_width = 0.001 # Set the pixel width in degrees
>>> # Calculate the pixel coordinates using the TAN projection
>>> sc_simplified_stars.pixel_xy(pixel_width)
>>> # Retrieve the calculated pixel coordinates
>>> xy = sc_simplified_stars.xy
>>> print(xy)
```

### Calculate the Geometric Invariants and the Asterism Indices of the Filtered Stars

To enhance star pattern recognition, STARQUERY can compute geometric invariants for triangles or quads formed by groups of stars. 

**1. Triangle Invariants**

More details refer to the Astroalign package developed by Beroiz, M. I. ([Astroalign Documentation](https://astroalign.quatrope.org/en/latest/)).

üåü **Steps**:

1. **Derive Geometric Invariants**
   
   - For each possible triangle formed by groups of three stars, compute unique geometric invariants as ratios $\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1},\frac{L_1}{L_0}\right)$, where,  $L_2$, $L_1$, $L_0$ are the sides of the triangle sorted in descending order.

2. **Construct a 2D-Tree Structure**
   
   - Use these invariants to build a 2D-Tree for efficient spatial queries.

3. **Associate Invariants with Star Indices**
   
   - Link each invariant set to the indices of the stars that form the corresponding triangle.

**2. Quad Invariants**

More details refer to Astrometry.net ([Astrometry.net Documentation](https://astrometry.net)).

üåü **Steps**:

1. **Derive Geometric Invariants**
   
   - For each group of four stars, choose the most widely separated pair to define a local coordinate system, labeling them as ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù.
   
   - The remaining stars ‚ÄúC‚Äù and ‚ÄúD‚Äù are positioned relative to this coordinate system with coordinates of ($x_C$, $y_C$) and ($x_D$, $y_D$) .
   
   - The resulting **geometric hash code** is the 4-vector:  ($x_C, y_C, x_D, y_D$) .

2. **Break Symmetries**
   
   - Enforce constraints  $x_C \leq x_D$ and  $x_C + x_D \leq 1$ to reduce redundant permutations.

3. **Construct a 4D-Tree Structure**
   
   - Utilize the invariants to build a 4D-Tree for efficient searching.

4. **Associate Invariants with Star Indices**
   
   - Link each set of invariants to the indices of the stars forming the quad.

```python
>>> # Choose the mode of geometric invariants to calculate: 'triangles' or 'quads'
>>> mode_invariants = 'triangles'

>>> # Calculate the geometric invariants
>>> sc_simplified_stars.invariantfeatures(mode_invariants)

>>> # Retrieve the generated invariants, asterisms, and 2D/4D-Tree structure
>>> invariants = sc_simplified_stars.invariants
>>> asterisms = sc_simplified_stars.asterisms
>>> kdtree = sc_simplified_stars.kdtree
>>> print(invariants,asterisms,kdtree)
```

### Visualization

STARQUERY supports visualizing both **conical** and **rectangular** search areas, highlighting the HEALPix tiles that intersect with the search region.

```python
>>> # Visualize the coverage of the box search area
>>> sc_simplified_stars.tiles_draw()
```

<p align="middle">
  <img src="readme_figs/box.png" width="500" />
</p>

```python
>>> # Visualize the coverage of the cone search area
>>> sc_simplified_stars.tiles_draw()
```

<p align="middle">
  <img src="readme_figs/cone.png" width="500" />
</p>

### Sky Division Using HEALPix

STARQUERY pre-divides the celestial sphere into **multi-level, equal-area sky regions** using the **HEALPix algorithm**. This hierarchical tiling system is used to optimize star catalog queries and facilitate blind star map matching.

**Key Features of HEALPix-based Division:**

- Divides the sky into **hierarchical levels** (from **K1** to **K11**).

- For each level, extracts the brightest stars (e.g., top 5 stars) and integrates them into the **K1** level.

- Calculates geometric invariants for star patterns and stores them in **h5-formatted hash files**.

<p align="middle">
  <img src="readme_figs/healpix_list.png" width="400" />
</p>

<p align="middle">
  <img src="readme_figs/healpix_table.png" width="400" />
</p>

```python
>>> k_min,k_max = 1,6
>>> sc_simplified.h5_hashes(k_min,k_max,mode_invariants)
>>> print(sc_simplified.hashed_h5)
```

The hash files store precomputed 

- **Center Pointing**: RA/Dec of the sky region center.

- **Pixel Coordinates**: Projected coordinates of stars in the region.

- **Geometric Invariants**: Features calculated for triangles or quads.

- **Asterism Indices**: Indices of stars forming each asterism.

### Read the h5-formatted Hash File

Once the hash file is generated, you can load and access the stored data for efficient blind star pattern recognition.

```python
>>> # Path to the hash file
>>> infile_h5 = 'starcatalogs/indices/at-hyg24_mag13.0_epoch2019.5_triangles_K1_K6.h5'
>>> # Load the hash data
>>> sc_hashed = sc_simplified.read_h5_hashes(infile_h5)
>>> print(sc_hashed.hashed_data)
```
